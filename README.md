# Probability-Statistics-and-Modelling-1-UCL

The main aim of the module is to equip students with the tools required to study real-world phenomena in a rigorous and quantitative way. It will show how quantitative concepts can be represented formally and provide an introduction to quantitative reasoning. In addition, the module aims to foster an intuitive understanding of uncertainty and to ensure that students are able to describe and interpret data arising in the study of crime.

# Key Projects

### Chi-square Goodness of Fitness Test
* Applied data visualization tools to showcase observed frequencies across each flower species 
* Conducted a Chi-square goodness of fitness test to make comparisons between 3 flower species categories 
* Summarized the Chi-square test analysis to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `ggstatsplot`

###  Chi-square Independence Test
* Created a Chi-square independence test model between between gender and product preferences
* Created a histogram model to quantify the relationship between gender and product preferences
* Used the Chi-square independence test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`

### One Sample T-Test
* Created a sample dataset of 20 apples to conduct mean weight analysis 
* Conducted a one sample t-test to make comparison between actual mean weight of apples and hypothesized mean weight of apples
* Used the one sample t-test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: No library used

### Two Sample T-Test
* Created a sample dataset of 30 apples from 2 orchards to conduct mean weight analysis 
* Conducted a two sample t-test to make comparison between mean weight of apples across orchards
* Used the two sample t-test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`

### Paired Sample T-Test
* Created a sample dataset of 30 participants' weights before and after diet programme to conduct mean student test score analysis 
* Conducted a paired sample t-test to make comparison between mean score of students test scores before and after study programme 
* Used the paired sample t-test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`

### One Way Anova-Test
* Created a sample dataset of 15 plants and their growth from fertlizer types to conduct mean growth analysis 
* Conducted a one way anova-test to make comparison between mean growth of plants and 3 fertilizer types 
* Used the one way anova-test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`

### Two Way Anova-Test
* Created a sample dataset of 50 plants and their growth from fertlizer types and water levels to conduct mean growth analysis 
* Conducted a two way anova-test to make comparison between crop yield of plants and 3 fertilizer types and water levels
* Used the two way anova-test results to make conclusions on hypotheses statements

**Libraries**: `ggplot2`
