# Probability-Statistics-and-Modelling-1-UCL

The main aim of the module is to equip students with the tools required to study real-world phenomena in a rigorous and quantitative way. It will show how quantitative concepts can be represented formally and provide an introduction to quantitative reasoning. In addition, the module aims to foster an intuitive understanding of uncertainty and to ensure that students are able to describe and interpret data arising in the study of crime.
